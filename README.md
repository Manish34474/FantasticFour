# Fantastic Four Simulation

A sophisticated multi-agent reinforcement learning simulation where heroes from the Fantastic Four defend Earth against the cosmic threat of Galactus and his herald, the Silver Surfer.

## Project Overview

This project implements a complex strategic environment where autonomous agents with distinct capabilities learn cooperative and competitive behaviors through independent Q-learning. The simulation features a toroidal grid world with specialized heroes, villains, and structural elements that must be protected or destroyed based on role-specific objectives.

## Key Features

- **Toroidal Grid Environment**: 20Ã—20 grid world with wraparound boundaries using Chebyshev distance calculations
- **Multiple Agent Types**: 7 distinct agent classes with unique capabilities and learning approaches
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Independent Q-learning for heroes with state discretization and reward shaping
- **Rule-Based Villains**: Galactus uses strategic targeting rather than learning
- **Special Abilities**: Character-specific powers including force fields, ranged attacks, and proximity bonuses
- **Visualization**: Tkinter-based GUI with real-time rendering and performance metrics
- **Metrics Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of rewards, win rates, and learning progress

## Agent Types

### Heroes
- **Reed Richards**: Strategic leader with enhanced repair capabilities
- **Sue Storm**: Defense specialist with configurable force fields
- **Human Torch**: Offensive specialist with ranged attacks (self-damage penalty)
- **The Thing**: Close-combat specialist with proximity bonuses
- **Franklin Richards**: Non-combat objective requiring protection

### Villains
- **Galactus**: Primary antagonist with rule-based strategic targeting
- **Silver Surfer**: Mobile herald with scanning and attack abilities

### Structures
- **Bridges**: Four strategic locations that must be maintained at full health
- **Headquarters**: Healing and resupply point for heroes

## Installation & Setup

### Using Python Virtual Environment
